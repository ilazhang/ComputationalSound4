Computational Sound Lab 4
Gain shift plugin
Pitch shift plugin
Both functionalities exist in the same plugin, in two separate sliders.
I apologize for any wonkiness in formatting or issues in building. I retyped the source files on the library computer, which had issues with downloading a C++ compiler, so I tried to keep things formatted the same as before and to make minimal changes to prevent errors
since I was unable to build in my final versions.
Please let me know of any questions.
Thank you for your time and everything you taught us this semester! It was truly a privilege to be part of this class.
